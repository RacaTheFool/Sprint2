# Overview

This project was my attempt to use Sprites in Python Arcade.
The code is from a previously working program of Skeet that
I did for a college course. I removed all the classes that
were originally used. I followed tutorials from [Python Arcade Library](https://arcade.academy/index.html)
in order to do this.

## DISCLAMER
The code currently isn't working perfectly. I have some
debugging to do to get it to correctly create objects
and deal with some lag issues.


## How To Play
This is a simple "Skeet" program. In the bottom right corner
there will be a "rifle" (in this case a gray rectangle)
that will shoot "bullets" (black triangles) in order to
hit randomly generated "targets" (orange circles).
Hitting a target will cause both the target that was hit and
the bullet that hit it to be removed from the game, as well as
increment the users score in the upper right corner of the
screen. Bullets and targets are also removed if they move
off-screen.

After I get the code working I will be adding a YouTube
link below of a demonstartion of my code.

# Development Environment

* GitHub
* Visual Studios Code
* Python
* Python Arcade

# Useful Websites

* [Python Arcade Library](https://arcade.academy/index.html)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)

# Future Work

* First thing I need to do is get it to run smooth and generate objects correctly
* Add other kinds of targets
* Add sound effects
* Add collision animation
